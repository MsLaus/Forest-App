**Forest App**

Motivated by a desire to assist people in overcoming focusing challenges and enhancing productivity, I undertook a personal project to develop a Focus Enhancement App featuring a Pomodoro timer. Utilizing JavaFX for the front-end
interface and PostgreSQL for the database, I created a user-friendly and effective tool to support users in managing their time and attention more efficiently. I implemented a database schema to store user profiles securely, including
usernames and encrypted passwords. This allows users to create personalized accounts, track their progress, and customize timer settings based on their preferences. 

For this project i used: Intellij, Java, JavaFX, PostgreSQL, Apache Maven, JUnit.

If the user chose to create a new account, a unique username and a password must be entered. The password must have at least 8 characters and needs to be entered twice. 
If the username is not unique or the passwords entered in the fields do not match, the account will not be created. The data will be stored in the database and the password will be hashed using Bcrypt.

**Timer** 


After the account is created or the user enters their account, they will see the timer that can go from 0 to 120 minutes. The timer can not be stopped or paused after it started to motivate the user to stay  focused and finish the task.
To further organize and categorize time, our application incorporates a tagging system. Users can create and assign tags to the time they focus. The tag can be changed when clicking on the tag icon.

Users have the freedom to personalize their digital forest by selecting from a variety of plant species. Whether it's a vibrant flower or a tree, users can choose plants that resonate with their preferences and personality. . For every 3 minutes focused, the user will get 1 gold and buy more plants from the shop.
