**About the project**
-------------------

Motivated by a desire to assist people in overcoming focusing challenges and enhancing productivity, I undertook a personal project to develop a Focus Enhancement App featuring a Pomodoro timer. Utilizing JavaFX for the front-end
interface and PostgreSQL for the database, I created a user-friendly and effective tool to support users in managing their time and attention more efficiently. I implemented a database schema to store user profiles securely, including
usernames and encrypted passwords. This allows users to create personalized accounts, track their progress, and customize timer settings based on their preferences.
